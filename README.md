# Organize-And-Rename-Files
  year-based subfolders A Python tool to automatically organize and rename images/videos by their date taken. It reads EXIF for photos, ffprobe metadata for videos, and places them in year-based folders with a consistent filename format (YYYY-MM-DD HH.MM.SS). Unrecognized files go to a skipped folder.
